Rosalind: Bioinformatics Stronghold
Problem: Independent Segregation of Chromosomes

Given: A positive integer n<=50.

Return: An array A of length 2n in which A[k] represents the common logarithm 
of the probability that two diploid siblings share at least k of their 2n 
chromosomes (we do not consider recombination for now).
