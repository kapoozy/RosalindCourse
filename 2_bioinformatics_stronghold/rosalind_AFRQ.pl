Problem: Counting Disease Carriers

Given: An array A for which A[k] represents the proportion of homozygous
recessive individuals for the k-th Mendelian factor in a diploid population.
Assume that the population is in genetic equilibrium for all factors.

Return: An array B having the same length as A in which B[k] represents the
probability that a randomly selected individual carries at least one copy of
the recessive allele for the k-th factor.
