Rosalind: Bioinformatics Stronghold
Problem: Counting Phylogenetic Ancestors

Given: A positive integer n (3 <= n <= 10000).
Return: The number of internal nodes of any unrooted binary tree having n leaves.
'''

# Rooted vs Unrooted:
# - A rooted binary tree with n leaves has 2n-2 edges, and n-1 internal nodes.
# - An unrooted binary tree with n leaves has 2n-3 edges and n-2 internal nodes
# (picture the root of a tree and it's two edges combining into a single edge).
