Rosalind: Bioinformatics Stronghold
Problem: Comparing Spectra with the Spectral Convolution
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/conv/

Given: Two multisets of positive real numbers S1 and S2. The size of each 
multiset is at most 200.

Return: The largest multiplicity of S1⊖S2, as well as the absolute value of 
the number x maximizing (S1⊖S2)(x) (you may return any such value if multiple 
solutions exist).
