Given: Two positive integers N and m, followed by an array A containing k 
integers between 0 and 2N. A[j] represents the number of recessive alleles for 
the j-th factor in a population of N diploid individuals.

Return: An m√ók matrix B for which Bi,j represents the common logarithm of the 
probability that after i generations, no copies of the recessive allele for 
the j-th factor will remain in the population. Apply the Wright-Fisher model.
