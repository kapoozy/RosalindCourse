URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/pcov/

Given: A collection of (error-free) DNA kk-mers (kâ‰¤50) taken from the same 
strand of a circular chromosome. In this dataset, all kk-mers from this strand 
of the chromosome are present, and their de Bruijn graph consists of exactly 
one simple cycle.

Return: A cyclic superstring of minimal length containing the reads (thus 
corresponding to a candidate cyclic chromosome).
