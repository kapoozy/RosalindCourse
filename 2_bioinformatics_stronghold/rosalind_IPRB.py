Given: Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing a population containing
k+m+n organisms: k individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, m are
heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive.
Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce
an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant
phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.
