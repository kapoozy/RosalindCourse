Rosalind: Bioinformatics Stronghold
Problem: Matching a Spectrum to a Protein
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/prsm/

Given: A positive integer nn followed by a collection of nn protein strings 
s1s1, s2s2, ..., snsn and a multiset RR of positive numbers (corresponding to 
the complete spectrum of some unknown protein string).

Return: The maximum multiplicity of RâŠ–S[sk] taken over all strings sk, 
followed by the string sk for which this maximum multiplicity occurs (you may 
output any such value if multiple solutions exist).
