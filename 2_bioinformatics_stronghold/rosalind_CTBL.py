Rosalind: Bioinformatics Stronghold
Problem: Creating a Character Table
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/ctbl/

Given: An unrooted binary tree T in Newick format for at most 200 species taxa.

Return: A character table having the same splits as the edge splits of T. The 
columns of the character table should encode the taxa ordered 
lexicographically; the rows of the character table may be given in any order. 
Also, for any given character, the particular subset of taxa to which 1s are 
assigned is arbitrary.
